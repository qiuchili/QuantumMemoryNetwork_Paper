% This is "sig-alternate.tex" V2.1 April 2013
% This file should be compiled with V2.5 of "sig-alternate.cls" May 2012
%
% This example file demonstrates the use of the 'sig-alternate.cls'
% V2.5 LaTeX2e document class file. It is for those submitting
% articles to ACM Conference Proceedings WHO DO NOT WISH TO
% STRICTLY ADHERE TO THE SIGS (PUBS-BOARD-ENDORSED) STYLE.
% The 'sig-alternate.cls' file will produce a similar-looking,
% albeit, 'tighter' paper resulting in, invariably, fewer pages.
%
% ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex file (and associated .cls V2.5) produces:
%       1) The Permission Statement
%       2) The Conference (location) Info information
%       3) The Copyright Line with ACM data
%       4) NO page numbers
%
% as against the acm_proc_article-sp.cls file which
% DOES NOT produce 1) thru' 3) above.
%
% Using 'sig-alternate.cls' you have control, however, from within
% the source .tex file, over both the CopyrightYear
% (defaulted to 200X) and the ACM Copyright Data
% (defaulted to X-XXXXX-XX-X/XX/XX).
% e.g.
% \CopyrightYear{2007} will cause 2007 to appear in the copyright line.
% \crdata{0-12345-67-8/90/12} will cause 0-12345-67-8/90/12 to appear in the copyright line.
%
% ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
% This .tex source is an example which *does* use
% the .bib file (from which the .bbl file % is produced).
% REMEMBER HOWEVER: After having produced the .bbl file,
% and prior to final submission, you *NEED* to 'insert'
% your .bbl file into your source .tex file so as to provide
% ONE 'self-contained' source file.

Sequential modelling is one of the key concern in textual represention. Recurrent Neural Network is a typicial practice for the textual task with sequential order. However, the hidden state of RNN and its variants  lack some interpretability for  human, which is called a black box. In this paper, we propose a new approach, namely Quantum Memory Network (QMN), to model a real-time semantic state in a dynamic sequential progress. Inspired by the quantum measurement, such semantic state is designed to descibe a explict distribution over all the semantic space via quantum density martix. The experiments \footnote{https://github.com/wabyking/QuantumMemoryNetwork} demostrate our model significantly outperform the baseline model.

\section{Introduction}


Sequential language modelling is a one of key concerns in Texual Information Retrieval and Natual Language Processing. Current state of art models like Recurrent Neural Network and it variants (LSTM and further) use a black-box  mechinsim to model language, which easily achieave  a better performance in the current supervised datset, but lack some inherent interpretability thus can not gernerate its similiar conclution to another dataset. Limited efforts  are trying to explain the inner mechinsim in sequential neural network (e.g. RNN, Encoder-Decoder, Memory Network), but in an empirical post-hoc conjecture after training \cite{lipton2016mythos}, e.g. network nisualizing in neural machine translation \cite{ding2017visualizing},  clustering analyzing for word embeddings \cite{trost2017parameter} and understanding hidden state vectors in neural readers\cite{wang2017emergent}. Interpretability in the perspective of transparency tends to be a vital issue for us to understand the mechanism by how these models work.

Recently, Quantum Theory have been appiled into many fields outside of physicis, e.g. Information Retrieval\cite{van2004geometry,melucci2011quantum}, Natual Language Processing\cite{blacoe2013quantum,zhang2018end}.

we will make a disclaimer about that here: with the exception
of the reference to the \LaTeX\ book, the citations in
this paper are to articles which have nothing to
do with the present subject and are used as
examples only.
